# Build a compiler using java code - Lexical Analyzer Generator
"Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes the modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. 
The lexical analyzer breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code."
